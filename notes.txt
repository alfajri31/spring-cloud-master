so if you want you project is not too subjective based on preference you can create unit test, you can create unit test
for more programmatic you can use mockito (package : myunittest) if more narrative you can use cucumber if you use cucumber
then you should add file *.feature and running cucumber from it, the folder testing in package test all files test in there.
basically you can add @Transactional in unit test to make sure you data not save to database
during your specified test until finished. if @Rollback(false) then it reversed the data during specified test will be saved
then if you want to cover all code project you can use mockito with 'right click' of the project and select 'more run/debug'
and then choose 'All Test' instead of 'All Features (cucumber)' will not work for with percentage of coverage
